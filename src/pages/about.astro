      About CS Club
    </h1>
    <p>
      The CS Club is a welcoming community that increases access to
      programming-reliant careers.
    </p><br />
    <p>
      We make open-source CS projects together, with gentle onboarding for
      beginners to professional-standard workflow. We are building a digital
      library of resources of self-learning guides, college opportunities, and
      career navigation. We connect students to experienced coders through tech
      events, invited speakers, an online communication space, and most
      importantly, having fun!
