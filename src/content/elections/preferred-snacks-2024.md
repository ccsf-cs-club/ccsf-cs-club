## Help Us Stock the Right Snacks!

Your input helps us plan better club events by knowing what snacks and refreshments you prefer. This ongoing poll will guide our catering decisions for meetings, workshops, hackathons, and social events.

## How to Vote

Using **STAR voting**, rate each snack option from 0-5 based on how much you'd like to see it at club events:
- **5**: Love it! Always want this available
- **4**: Really enjoy this option  
- **3**: Good choice, would be happy to see it
- **2**: Okay, but not my preference
- **1**: Not really interested
- **0**: Please no, or dietary restrictions prevent me from enjoying this

## Snack Categories

### Main Snacks
Options that can serve as a light meal during longer events.

### Light Snacks  
Easy finger foods perfect for networking and casual munching.

### Healthy Options
Nutritious choices for health-conscious members.

### Desserts
Sweet treats for celebrations and morale boosts.

### Beverages
Drinks to keep us hydrated and energized.

## Your Input Matters

We use these results to:
- Budget for the most popular items
- Ensure dietary variety at events
- Plan special themed snack days
- Work with vendors and local businesses
- Accommodate member preferences and restrictions

Vote anytime! We review results monthly to adjust our event planning.
