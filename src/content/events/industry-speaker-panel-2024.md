Frank in his last semester as a CS, Math, and Data Science Major at CCSF organized a group of speakers to share their insight on March 13th from 12:00-1:30 PST in Batmale 413.

Panel includes a software engineer from OpenAI, who has been there since the company was small and just a start-up. An engineer from YouTube. A data scientist who works with a start-up that works with the city of SF and Seattle to improve transportation. And finally, we have a technical recruiter who works in fintech.
