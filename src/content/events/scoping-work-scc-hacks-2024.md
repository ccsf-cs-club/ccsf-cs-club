## The Challenge: Building Something Meaningful in 48 Hours

At SCC Hacks, I found myself in a familiar yet challenging situation: leading a team of talented individuals I'd just met, with only 48 hours to build something meaningful. The key lesson I learned? **Scoping isn't just about cutting features—it's about identifying the core value proposition and ruthlessly protecting it.**

## The Scoping Framework That Worked

### 1. Start with the "Why"
Before we wrote a single line of code, we spent the first hour defining our core value proposition. Not just "what are we building?" but "why does this matter?" This became our north star when difficult decisions arose.

### 2. The 70-20-10 Rule
- **70%** of our time went to core functionality that directly served our value proposition
- **20%** went to polish and user experience improvements
- **10%** was reserved for "nice-to-haves" and contingency

### 3. Feature Triage Categories
We categorized every potential feature into three buckets:
- **Must-have**: Without this, our solution doesn't work
- **Should-have**: This significantly improves the user experience
- **Could-have**: This would be cool but isn't essential

## The Personal Growth Moment

The biggest learning came when we had 6 hours left and discovered a major technical blocker. My instinct was to power through and fix it. Instead, I had to make the hard call to pivot our implementation approach, cutting two "should-have" features to preserve our core functionality.

**This taught me**: In product management, your job isn't to deliver everything—it's to deliver the right things that create maximum value.

## Takeaways for Future Collaborations

1. **Time-box decision making**: We gave ourselves exactly 15 minutes for each major technical decision
2. **Daily scope reviews**: Even in a 48-hour sprint, we checked our scope twice per day
3. **Celebrate the cuts**: Every feature we cut was a win because it meant more focus on what mattered

## The Meta-Lesson

The most valuable insight wasn't about project management—it was about leadership in uncertain environments. When you're working with new people under tight constraints, your primary job is creating clarity and confidence, not just managing tasks.

This experience fundamentally changed how I approach scoping in all my projects, whether they're hackathons, coursework, or professional work. The principles remain the same: know your why, protect your core, and make deliberate trade-offs.
